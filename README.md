A guessing game where the user has to guess a secret integer from 0 to 100. After every guess the program tells the user whether their integer was too large or too small.

If the user provides an answer which isn't an integer, or an integer above 100 or below 0, it does not count as an attempt.

When the user suceed, the number of attempts will be printed.
